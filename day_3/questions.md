## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
# A conditional statement is a check on logic, basically asking if something is true or false. '==' asks if a variable is equal to the value described, >= asks if the variable is greater than or equal to the value, and && asks if a variable is true following an already true value.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
# When starting a conditional block of code and the output of the program depends on the value matching the condition given.
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if <variable> <conditional> <value>
  <output>
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

#using elsif and else

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

if <variable> <conditional> <value>
  <output>
elsif <variable> <possibly_different_conditional> <possibly_different_value>
  <different_output>
else <variable> <possibly_different_conditional_2> <possibly_different_value_2>
  <different_output_2>


1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
# When there is only one value that represent a 'true' or 'false' condition, but many values that represent the opposite as in 'unless'
